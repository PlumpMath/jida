# Jida

A tool for experimenting and sharing with Codeq/Datomic without much effort

## Usage

For now, visit http://jida.herokuapp.com - Deploy instructions will come later

## TODO

 * Add deploy instructions for frontend to Heroku
 
## Ideas
 
 * Function-specific queries: explore functions
 * Function history: Most frequent commit author ("Who changed this function most?")
 * Calculate code complexity for a function over time, sort by current most complex functions, who contributed most complexity, when?
 * Repo-wide queries: explore projects
 * Author-specific queries: explore contributor history
 * Allow me to save/share/fork queries I think are useful
 * Related to 5, take queries from url for pastie-like sharing
